# Applications of Reinforcement Learning to Computer Networks
This repo outlines the steps on how to use the _**OWL**_ application in a VM running ```Linux``` operating system or on a ```Linux``` standalone computer. The original repository that contains the implementation of  _**OWL**_ can be found here _**[tcp-owl](https://github.com/alessiosac/tcp-owl)**_.

For simplicity and ease of setup, we provisioned and packaged a VM with _**OWL**_ already installed and setup. Below are detailed step on how to retrieve the VM and test out the _**OWL**_ application.

# Get the VM
Visit this **[Download image](https://google.com)** to get the VM image that contains a preinstalled _**OWL**_ application. The image format is in Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) and can be imported into any virtualization platform of your choice. We conduct our test of the image using Oracle virtualbox, hence we recommend that you use Oracle virtualbox.
